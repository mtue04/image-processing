# Project 02: Applied Mathematics & Statistics for IT
## Overview
This project implements several basic image processing functions using Python. The main features include adjusting brightness, contrast, flipping images, converting to grayscale/sepia, blurring, sharpening, cropping, and resizing images. The project utilizes NumPy, PIL (Pillow), and matplotlib for efficient image manipulation and visualization.

## Prerequisites
The project relies on the following Python libraries:
  - numpy
  - PIL (Pillow)
  - matplotlib
    
You can install the required libraries using: `pip install numpy pillow matplotlib`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Prepare the images to compress and place them in the images/ folder.
3. Run cells in Jupyter file  `22127440.ipynb`

## Features
  - Brightness Adjustment: Modify the brightness of the image using an alpha value.
  - Contrast Adjustment: Adjust image contrast with a scaling factor.
  - Flip Image: Flip the image horizontally or vertically.
  - Grayscale/Sepia Conversion: Convert an RGB image into grayscale or sepia.
  - Blur and Sharpen: Apply Gaussian blur or Laplacian sharpening to the image.
  - Cropping: Crop the image either from the center or using circular or elliptical masks.
  - Zoom: Resize the image with a zoom factor.
